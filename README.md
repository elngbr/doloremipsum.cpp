# Ticketing App Overview 

This project entails the development of a ticketing application for managing tickets issued for various events such as movies, plays, and sports matches.
The application provides functionalities for defining event locations, event details, and generating nominal tickets with unique identifiers.
Functionalities 
Reading Event Location Characteristics: Users can input characteristics of the event location such as maximum number of seats, number of rows, zones, and seat coding. 
Reading Event Characteristics: Users can input event details including date, time, and name. 
Ticket Generation: Tickets can be generated based on desired characteristics such as VIP, lawn, tribune, or boxes. 
Unique Ticket ID Generation: Each generated ticket will have a unique ID to prevent duplication and guessing. 
Validation of Tickets: The application allows for validating tickets using their unique IDs. 
Error Handling: The application handles invalid inputs and displays error messages accordingly. 

# Phase 1 Requirements 
Minimum of 3 classes related to the project. 
Each class must contain dynamically allocated vectors, constant and static fields, and methods. 
Attributes are defined in the private area of the class. 
Accessor methods are provided for all attributes with validation in setters. 
Each class contains at least 2 generic methods for various processing. 
Overloads for << and >> operators are implemented. 
Each class has default and parameterized constructors, adhering to the "rule of 3" (destructor + copyconstructor + overloading of equals operator) for classes with pointer members. 
At least 2 overloaded operators are implemented per class. 
Classes are implemented in their own header and/or cpp files. 
Main function is located in a separate cpp file. 
Git repository is used for version control with multiple commits documenting changes. 


# Phase 2 Requirements 
Command-line parameter support for file input. 
Application can process data from a text file. 
Binary files are used for saving and restoring issued tickets. 
Functional menu for user navigation. 
Inheritance with at least one new class derived from an existing one. 
At least one abstract class with a pure virtual method. 
Existing classes have virtual methods overriden by derived classes. Use of an STL container in at least one class. 
Ticketing scenarios are correctly implemented and functional.
